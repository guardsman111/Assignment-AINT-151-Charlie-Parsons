<h3>About me (Charlie Parsons)</h3>

<p id="about"></br>Hi there, I'm Charlie. I'm the creator of The Randomest Dungeon. It's my first solo work I have produced from start to finish. </br></br><strong>Who am I?</strong></br>I am a student at the University of Plymouth, where I am currently studying Computing and Games Development. I thoroughly enjoy my course, and I spend a large amount of time tinkering with games and software in my own time.</br></br><strong>What do I do
in my spare time?</strong></br>I like to spend my time gaming (favourites include Overwatch, Rainbow Six Siege and the XCOM games), chilling out on a longboard with my friends, and dressing up to play Airsoft.</br></br><strong>Where do I want to go?</strong></br>I would like to be an indie developer producing strategy games. That is why my games will often contain procedural generation features, or be strategy based. Strategy and
RNG's go hand in hand, so they are what I'm going to practice.</p>
